### An implementation wireless device capable of sending and recieving unaddressed and unreliable messages using 433/315 MHz ASK RF module and RTLSDR.


Ever wondered, how actually the digital data is encoded to radio waves and transferred wirelessly over the air to another device? I started this project to answer some ot these question and to understand how the data is actually transferred at physical and data link layer.

This project uses simple 433/315 MHz ASK RF module as the TX and RTLSDR as the RX to send unaddressable, unreliable message between the two. The applications of such communication system are Grarge Door Opener, Wireless alaram and monitoring devices. 

## Hardware Required

* 433/315 MHz ASK RF module
* RTLSDR
* Arduino
